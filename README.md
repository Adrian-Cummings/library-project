# library-project
This is a small Library project created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I challenged myself not to use any pre-existing libraries to see what I could come up with using my own abilities.

The application is simple. Click the green + Button to add a new book to your library. Include the relavent information, and a link to an image of the book's cover. After submiting the form your book will be added to the library. From the Library view you are able to mark a book as complete once you've finished reading it, or delete the book from your library. All of the books you add, or mark complete are saved into your browsers local storage, and therefore will remain there until you've cleared your history or browser cache.
